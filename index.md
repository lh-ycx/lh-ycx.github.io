I'm a 3rd-year PhD student in [EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xuanzhe Liu](liuxuanzhe.com). Here is my [cv](/res/cv.pdf).

I got my B.S. degree in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My research interest is data privacy, including privacy protection in ML (i.e. federated learning) and compliance checking in big data platforms.
